# react_dashboard



### Tools used and don't:
- used create-react-app for crash course at least
- used "es7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-native snippets VSCode extension - shortcuts for react (rce + tab - creates component, rfc - function type component)

### What is about: 
- i'll take a crash course - create toDo as always - Done.
- i'll take redux crash couse 
- then i'll try to create some dashboard/knowledge base template


### To Do/Learn:
- Redux - state holder. Because now todo doesn't have it - have to do "components drill" - instead just markComplete in "todoItem" -> a lot of props to get to most parent App.js
- react hooks - maybe
- webpack - maybe during deploy
- PropTypes for React - used already in Todo app
- deployment to real server 
- docker image for this app
- css framework. Boostrap maybe
- css itself - CSS3
- event.preventDefault() for submitting form - read what is default for forms
- !!! Component state methods - didMount/etc.
- npm run build - gues what will happen ). Investigate how to deploy on own server. 
- redux - basically not for react , youcan use it with any library. react-redux - in this case
- redux "createStore" function. What is "store" - general state storage in general. Refer to redux github
- Learn how to use async/await with react/redux

# maybe once more take a look at traversity - maybe implement as Founbdvideo - hardcore a bit )
