# react_dashboard

### Tools used and don't:
- used create-react-app for crash course at least
- used "es7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-native snippets VSCode extension - shortcuts for react (rce + tab - creates component)

### What is about: 
- i'll take a crash course - create toDo as always
- then i'll try to create some dashboard/knowledge base for ongoing work


### To Do/Learb:
- Redux - state holder
- react hooks - maybe
- webpack 
- PropTypes for React - used already in Todo app
- deployment to real server 
- docker image for this app
- css framework. Boostrap maybe
- css itself - CSS3
- read/learn what is npx (intall but not add to dependencies)
